Floor Layout Plan, AutoCAD Image
In this way the best solution was the use of a porcelanato and a mortar "floor-to-floor", when there is no need to remove the old floor for the settlement of the new coating.

The main request of the customers was the comfort for the whole family. Having a super busy life because of work they have as hobby to watch a movie accompanied by a good wine. 

Thus, a modern wine cellar with space for wine cellar and compartments for 18 wines was developed.

Customers are fond of antique and classic pieces, so the layout was developed so that the pieces are the highlight in the project. 

Modern furniture with straight lines in light colors so as not to contrast with the pictures, silverware and the older furniture. A real trip back in time from the old to the contemporary.

The project was developed by AutoCAD software and 3D in Revit.
